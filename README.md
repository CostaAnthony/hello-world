# hello-world
for  practicing with github
Hey, my name is Anthony Costa, I am a second-year Computer Science major. I have been working at Men's Wearhouse for a couple of years now. I do not know much about this course but I do hope this course helps me to get a project and more skills to help me get a career. by the end of this class, I hope to be a better team player and programmer. I am decent at coding with Java, I also know the basics of Python and a little JavaFX too.
